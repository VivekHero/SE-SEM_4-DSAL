1. A dictionary stores keywords and its meanings. Provide facility for adding
new keywords, deleting keywords, updating values of any entry. Provide
facility to display whole data sorted in ascending/ Descending order. Also
find how many maximum comparisons may require for finding any
keyword. Use Binary Search Tree for implementation.


2. Beginning with an empty binary tree, Construct binary tree by inserting
the values in the order given. After constructing a binary tree perform
following operations on it-
a) Perform inorder, preorder and post order traversal
b) Change a tree so that the roles of the left and right pointers are
swapped at every node
c) Find the height of tree
d) Copy this tree to another [operator=]
e) Count number of leaves, number of internal nodes.
f) Erase all nodes in a binary tree.
(Implement both recursive and non-recursive methods)


3. Create an inordered threaded binary search tree. Perform inorder, preorder
traversals without recursion and deletion of a node. Analyze time and
space complexity of the algorithm.


4. Consider telephone book database of N clients. Make use of a hash table
implementation to quickly look up clientâ€˜s telephone number. Make use
of two collision handling techniques and compare them using number of
comparisons required to find a set of telephone numbers (Note: Use linear
probing with replacement and without replacement)


5. Implement all the functions of a dictionary (ADT) using open hashing
technique: separate chaining using linked list
Data: Set of (key, value) pairs, Keys are mapped to values, Keys must be
comparable, and Keys must be unique. Standard Operations: Insert(key,
value), Find(key), Delete(key)


6. Represent a given graph using adjacency list to perform DFS and BFS.
Use the map of the area around the college as the graph. Identify the
prominent land marks as nodes and perform DFS and BFS on that.


7. You have a business with several offices; you want to lease phone lines to
connect them up with each other; and the phone company charges
different amounts of money to connect different pairs of cities. You want
a set of lines that connects all your offices with a minimum total cost.
Solve the problem by suggesting appropriate data structures.


8. Given sequence k = k1 <k2 < ... <kn of n sorted keys, with a search
probability pi for each key ki. Build the Binary search tree that has the
least search cost given the access probability for each key.


9. A Dictionary stores keywords and its meanings. Provide facility for adding new keywords, deleting keywords, updating values of any entry. Provide facility to display whole data sorted in ascending/ Descending order. Also find how many maximum comparisons may require for finding any keyword. Use Height balance tree and find the complexity for finding a keyword.

10. Read the marks obtained by students of second year in an online examination of particular subject. Find out maximum / minimum marks obtained in that subject. Use heap data structure. Analyze the algorithm.

11. Department maintains a student information. The file contains roll number, name, division and address. Allow user to add, delete information of student. Display information of particular employee. If record of student does not exist an appropriate message is displayed. If it is, then the system displays the student details. Use sequential file to main the data.

12. Implementation of a direct access file -Insertion and deletion of a record from a direct access file
